My research project for MPhil degree
🚢 Ship Detection in the Exclusive Economic Zone of Mauritius in Sentinel-2 Imagery using CNNs & Yolov11


📌 Overview
This repository contains the code and experiments from my MPhil research, where I explored the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and YOLOv11 for detecting ships in Sentinel-2 optical satellite imagery.
The goal was to support maritime surveillance by building AI models capable of identifying ships within the Mauritian EEZ — a region critical for security, illegal fishing prevention, and environmental monitoring.


🛰️ Background
- Monitoring maritime activity in EEZs is essential for safety, security, and resource management.
- Traditional surveillance (patrol vessels, radars) is expensive and limited in coverage.
- Satellite imagery + AI offers scalable and cost-effective monitoring.
